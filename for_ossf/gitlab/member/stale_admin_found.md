## Admininistrators Should Have Activity in the Last 6 Months
policy name: stale_admin_found

severity: MEDIUM

### Description
A collaborator with global admin permissions didn't do any action in the last 6 months. Admin users are extremely powerful and common compliance standards demand keeping the number of admins at minimum. Consider revoking this collaborator admin credentials (downgrade to regular user), or remove the user completely.

### Threat Example(s)
Stale admins are most likely not managed and monitored, increasing the possibility of being compromised.



### Remediation
1. Go to admin menu
2. Select "Overview -> Users" on the left navigation bar
3. Find the stale admin and either delete of block it
