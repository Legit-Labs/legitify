## Project Should Require All Pipelines to Succeed
policy name: requires_status_checks

severity: MEDIUM

### Description
Checks that validate the quality and security of the code are not required to pass before submitting new changes. It is advised to turn this flag on to ensure any existing or future check will be required to pass.

### Threat Example(s)
Not defining a set of required status checks can make it easy for contributors to introduce buggy or insecure code as manual review, whether mandated or optional, is the only line of defense.



### Remediation
1. Make sure you can manage project merge requests permissions
2. Go to the project's settings page
3. Select "Merge Requests"
4. Press on the "Pipelines must succeed"
5. Click "Save changes"
