# scope: rule
# title: Runner group is not limited to private repositories
# description: |
#       Workflows from public repositories are allowed to run on GitHub Hosted Runners.
#       When using GitHub Hosted Runners, it is recommended to allow only workflows from private repositories to run on these runners to avoid being vulnerable
#       to malicious actors using workflows from public repositories to break into your private network.
#       In case of inadequate security measures implemented on the hosted runner,
#       malicious actors could fork your repository and then pwn-requests (Create a pull-request from a forked repository to the base repository with malicious intentions)
#       that create a workflow that exploits these vulnerabilities and move laterally inside your network.
