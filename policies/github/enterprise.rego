# title: Enterprise Should Use Single-Sign-On
# description: It is recommended to enable access to an enterprise via SAML single sign-on (SSO) by authenticating through an identity provider (IdP). This allows for central account control and for timely access revocations.

#   threat: Not using an SSO solution makes it more difficult to track a potentially compromised user's actions accross different systems, prevents the organization from enterprise a common password policy, and makes it challenging to audit different aspects of the user's behavior.
