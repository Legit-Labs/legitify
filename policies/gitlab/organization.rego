# title: Two-Factor Authentication Is Not Enforced For The Group
# description: The two-factor authentication requirement is not enabled at the group level. Regardless of whether users are managed externally by SSO, it is highly recommended to enable this option, to reduce the risk of a deliberate or accidental user creation without MFA.
# custom:
#   severity: HIGH
#   remediationSteps:
#     - Go to the group page
#     - Press Settings -> General
#     - Expand "Permissions and group features"
#     - Toggle "Require all users in this group to set up two-factor authentication"
#     - Press "Save Changes"
#   threat:
#     - If an attacker gets the valid credentials for one of the organizationâ€™s users they can authenticate to your GitHub organization.

# title: Collaborators Can Fork Repositories To External Namespaces
# description: The ability to fork project to external namespaces is turned on. Forking repositories poses security issues due to the loss of control over the code. It is recommended to disable this feature if it is not explicitly needed, in order to proactively prevent code leakage.

# title: Group does not enforce branch protection by default
# description: You do not have a default full branch protection for a specific group, which means any new repository will be created without it. In fully protected level, developers cannot push new commits, and no one can force push or delete the branch. Protecting branches ensures new code changes must go through a controlled merge process and it allows enforcement of code review and other security tests.

#   remediationSteps:

#     - Press Settings -> Repository
#     - Expand "Default Branch" section
#     - Toggle the required protection rule
#     - Press "Save Changes"
#   threat:
#     - A developer creates a repository without any branch protection rules
#     - Attacker that get access to the repository can modify its main branch without any restrictions
