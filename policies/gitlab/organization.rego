# title: Two-Factor Authentication Is Not Enforced For The Group
# description: The two-factor authentication requirement is not enabled at the group level. Regardless of whether users are managed externally by SSO, it is highly recommended to enable this option, to reduce the risk of a deliberate or accidental user creation without MFA.
