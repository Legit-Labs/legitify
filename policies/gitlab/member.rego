#     - Collaborators without two-factor authentication are prime targets for phishing and social engineering attacks, as compromise only requires acquiring the collaborator's password.
#     - This is doubly important for external collaborators, as these are identities that aren't likely managed by you or your organization and may be easier to compromise.

# title: Administrators Should Have Activity in the Last 6 Months
# description: A collaborator with global admin permissions didn't perform any action in the last 6 months. Admin users are extremely powerful, and common compliance standards demand keeping the number of admins to a minimum. Consider revoking this collaborator's admin credentials (downgrade to regular user) or removing the user completely.
# custom:
#   severity: MEDIUM
#   remediationSteps:
#     - 1. Go to the admin menu
#     - 2. Select 'Overview -> Users' on the left navigation bar
#     - 3. Find the stale admin and either delete or block it
#   threat:
#     - Stale admins are most likely not managed and monitored, increasing the possibility of being compromised.
