## Default Branch Should Limit Code Review to Code-Owners
policy name: code_review_not_limited_to_code_owners

severity: LOW

### Description

1. Make sure you have admin permissions
2. Go to the repo's settings page
3. Enter "Branches" tab
4. Under "Branch protection rules"
5. Click "Edit" on the default branch rule

7. Check "Require review from Code Owners"
8. Click "Save changes"
