## Default Workflow Token Permission Should Be Set To Read Only
policy name: token_default_permissions_is_read_write

severity: MEDIUM

### Description
The default GitHub Action workflow token permission is set to read-write. When creating workflow tokens, it is highly recommended to follow the Principle of Least Privilege and force workflow authors to specify explicitly which permissions they need.

### Threat Example(s)
In case of token compromise (due to a vulnerability or malicious third-party GitHub actions), an attacker can use this token to sabotage various assets in your CI/CD pipeline, such as packages, pull-requests, deployments, and more.



### Remediation
1. Make sure you have admin permissions
2. Go to the org's settings page
3. Enter "Actions - General" tab
4. Under 'Workflow permissions'
5. Select 'Read repository contents permission'
6. Click 'Save'
