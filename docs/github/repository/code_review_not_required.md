## Default Branch Should Require Code Review
policy name: code_review_not_required

severity: HIGH

### Description
In order to comply with separation of duties principle and enforce secure code practices, a code review should be mandatory using the source-code-management system's built-in enforcement. This option is found in the branch protection setting of the repository.

### Threat Example(s)
Users can merge code without being reviewed, which can lead to insecure code reaching the main branch and production.



### Remediation
Note: The remediation steps apply to legacy branch protections, rules set-based protection should be updated from the rules set page
1. Make sure you have admin permissions
2. Go to the repo's settings page
3. Enter 'Branches' tab
4. Under 'Branch protection rules'
5. Click 'Edit' on the default branch rule
6. Check 'Require a pull request before merging'
7. Check 'Require approvals'
8. Set 'Required number of approvals before merging' to 1 or more
9. Click 'Save changes'
