## Forking Allowed for This Repository
policy name: allow_forking_enabled

severity: LOW

### Description
Forking a repository can lead to loss of control and potential exposure of the source code. The option to fork must be disabled by default and turned on only by admins deliberately when opting to create a fork. If you do not need forking, it is recommended to turn it off in the repository configuration.


### Remediation
1. Make sure you have admin permissions
2. Go to the repo's settings page
3. Enter "General" tab
4. Under "Features"
5. Toggle off "Allow forking"
