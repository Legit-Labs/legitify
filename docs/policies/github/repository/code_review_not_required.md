## Default Branch Doesn't Require Code Review
policy name: code_review_not_required

severity: HIGH

### Description
In order to comply with separation of duties principle and enforce secure code practices, a code review should be mandatory using the source-code-management built-in enforcement. This option is found in the branch protection setting of the repository. An even safer option is to require 2 separate reviewers, which is enforced in the Legitify policy "Default Branch Doesn't Require Code Review By At Least Two Reviewers".


### Remediation
1. Make sure you have admin permissions
2. Go to the repo's settings page
3. Enter "Branches" tab
4. Under "Branch protection rules"
5. Click "Edit" on the default branch rule
6. Check "Require a pull request before merging"
7. Check "Require approvals"
8. Set "Required number of approvals before merging" to 1 or more
9. Click "Save changes"
