## Unsigned Commits Are Allowed
policy name: no_signed_commits

severity: LOW

### Description
Require all commits to be signed and verified

### Threat Example(s)
A commit containing malicious code may be crafted by a malicious actor that has acquired write access to the repository to initiate a supply chain attack. Commit signing provides another layer of defense that can prevent this type of compromise.



### Remediation
1. Make sure you have owner permissions
2. Go to the projects's settings -> Repository page
3. Enter "Push Rules" tab. Set the "Reject unsigned commits" checkbox
