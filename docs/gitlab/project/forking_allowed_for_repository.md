## Forking Allowed for This Repository
policy name: forking_allowed_for_repository

severity: LOW

### Description
Forking a repository can lead to loss of control and potential exposure of the source code. The option to fork must be disabled by default and turned on only by owners deliberately when opting to create a fork. If you do not need forking, it is recommended to turn it off in the project's configuration.

### Threat Example(s)
Forked repositories may leak important code assets or sensitive secrets embedded in the code to anyone outside your organization, as the code becomes publicy-accessible



### Remediation
1. Make sure you have owner permissions
2. Go to the project's settings page
3. Enter "General" tab
4. Under "Visibility
5. project features
6. permissions"
7. Toggle off "Forks"
