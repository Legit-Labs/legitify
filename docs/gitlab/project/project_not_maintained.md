## Project not maintained
policy name: project_not_maintained

severity: HIGH

### Description
The project was not active in the last 3 months. A project which is not active might not be patched against security issues within its code and dependencies, and is therefore at higher risk of including unpatched vulnerabilities.

### Threat Example(s)
As new vulnerabilities are found over time, unmaintained repositories are more likely to point to dependencies that have known vulnerabilities, exposing these repositories to 1-day attacks.



### Remediation
1. Make sure you have admin permissions
2. Either Delete or Archive the project
