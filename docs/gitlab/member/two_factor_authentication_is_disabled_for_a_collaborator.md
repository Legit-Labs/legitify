## Two Factor Authentication Should Be Enabled for Collaborators
policy name: two_factor_authentication_is_disabled_for_a_collaborator

severity: HIGH

### Description
A collaborator's two factor authentication is disabled. Turn it on in the collaborator setting, or globally in the account, to prevent any access without MFA.

### Threat Example(s)
Collaborators without two-factor authentication are prime targets for phishing and social engineering attacks, as compromise only requires acquiring the collaborator's password.



### Remediation
1. Login with the user credentials
2. Go to the user settings page
3. Select 'Account' on the left navigation bar
4. Press 'Enable two-factor authentication'
