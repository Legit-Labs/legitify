## Group Should Enforce Branch Protection
policy name: group_does_not_enforce_branch_protection_by_default

severity: MEDIUM

### Description
The default branch should be protected in each group so that any new repository will be created with a protected default branch by default. In fully protected level, developers cannot push new commits, and no one can force push or delete the branch. Protecting branches ensures new code changes must go through a controlled merge process and it allows enforcement of code review and other security tests.

### Threat Example(s)
A developer creates a repository without any branch protection rules
An attacker that gains access to the repository can modify its main branch without any restrictions



### Remediation
1. Go to the group page
2. Press Settings -> Repository
3. Expand 'Default Branch' section
4. Toggle the required protection rule
5. Press 'Save Changes'
